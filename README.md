# local-explorer-ai
An intelligent local discovery application that leverages the Gemini API with Google Maps grounding to provide up-to-date, accurate information about nearby places. Ask a question, and get AI-powered answers with direct links to Google Maps for sources.

🌍 AI Local Explorer: Intelligent Location Discovery
The AI Local Explorer is an innovative application that revolutionizes local discovery by combining the reasoning power of the Gemini API with the rich, real-time geospatial data of Google Maps Grounding. This project transforms conversational queries into factually accurate, up-to-date, and highly relevant information about nearby businesses, landmarks, and points of interest.

✨ Key Features
Intelligent & Conversational Search: Ask natural language questions like, "What's a quiet cafe with outdoor seating near me?" or "Plan a quick evening itinerary in the downtown area." The Gemini model intelligently processes the request.

Google Maps Grounding: Responses are fact-checked and grounded in over 250 million real-world places from the Google Maps ecosystem. This drastically reduces AI hallucinations and ensures information like hours of operation, addresses, and user reviews are accurate and current.

Up-to-Date Local Data: Access timely details, including current business hours, temporary closures, and insights derived from recent user reviews, making your local recommendations reliable.

Direct Maps Integration & Citations: Every AI-generated answer is paired with a direct, verifiable link to the Google Maps source, allowing users to confirm the information and navigate immediately.

Contextualized Recommendations: Get hyper-local, personalized suggestions. The AI can factor in preferences and location to provide recommendations that go beyond a simple list (e.g., finding kid-friendly neighborhoods or restaurants with specific ambiance).
